\begin{abstract}
Our perliminary experiments with Amazon Echo have found that the recorded part of the same command is not consistent across different trials. This stimulates us to question and examine the behaviour of Amazon Echo and dig into what is exactly being collected by it. We plan to use netwrok traffic mearsurement for our work, with which previous researchers have been able to infer users' activities \cite{apthorpe2017spying} and establish network signatures for Amazon Echo \cite{ford2019alexa}. If this approach does work, we will be able to answer a whole set of research questions with it.
