\begin{abstract}
We examine the problem of whether Amazon is being honest with users in presenting the audio data it collected. Amazon Echo is Amazon's smart speaker that has an always-on mircophone. It would start recording after hearing certain wake word (Alexa, Echo, etc.) and then send the recorded audio to its server for further processing. Amazon allows user to browse and delete all audio data sent to them. We suspect that the audio data made available to users might only be a subset of the audio being collected and trasmitted to the server, and our initial experiments suggest that this might be the case.
