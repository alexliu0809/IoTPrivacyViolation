\section{Amazon Echo and Alexa}
Amazon Echo is a smart speaker developed by Amazon that is connected to the internet \cite{wikipedia_2019}. It has an always-on microphone that would start recording automatically after hearing certain wake word (Alexa, Echo, etc.). Voice commands following the wake word will be streamed to Amazon's cloud-based intelligent command handling program, known as Alexa, for further processing. Alexa will then try to respond to users' commands. Amazon would also keep a copy of the voice command and the response, collectively known as response cards \cite{ford2019alexa}. These response cards have been made available to users by Amazon for various reasons such that they can be viewed, played, and deleted \cite{amazon_2010}.
