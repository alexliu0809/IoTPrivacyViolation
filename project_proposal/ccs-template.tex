\begin{abstract}
IoT devices capable of capturing and uploading user-generated audio have become increasingly popular nowadays. While it is widely perceived that these devices would start recording after hearing specific trigger words, little work has been done on understanding how long these devices are recording, and more importantly, how much is being uploaded. This work tries to answer these questions using network traffic analysis. We plan to design artificial input that would set off a specific pattern of IoT traffic, monitoring which would give us the ability to infer how much information is being sent over to the server.
