\section{Conclusion And Future Work}
We have presented some of the first measurements to understand the behavior of Echo in terms of what is being transmitted by Echo. More specifically, we found that: 1. Usually Echo is not transmitting any audio that happens before it is activated; 2. In the case of correctly detecting the end of a command, Echo will not stream any conversation that occurs after the command; 3. A 0.7 second gap is needed for Echo to correctly detect the end of a command. While there is a large amount of research on analyzing Echoâ€™s network traffic, ours is the first to use its network traffic to characterize its behavior quantitatively.

Despite having some inspiring results, we did notice some apparent limitations in this work and would leave them for future work. First, we only performed the experiment with one specific command. Thus, our findings do not necessarily generalize to scenarios where other Echo commands are used. Second, we observed a few cases in all of the experiments where the amount of data transmitted was unexpected. We were unable to analyze and explain what happened as we could not decrypt the data. Finally, there is inherent weakness of our approach --- inferring Echo's behavior through measuring its traffic. Noise and other disturbances made it harder for us to draw any conclusion statistically.
