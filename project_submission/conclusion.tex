\section{Conclusion And Future Work}
We have presented some of the first measurements that seek to understand the behavior of the Echo in terms of what is being transmitted by the Echo. More specifically, we found that: 1) The Echo is not usually transmitting any audio that happens before it is activated; 2) In the case of correctly detecting the end of a command, Echo will not stream any conversation that occurs after the command; 3) A 0.7~s gap is needed for the Echo to correctly detect the end of a command. While there is a large amount of research on analyzing the Echoâ€™s network traffic, ours is the first to use its network traffic to characterize its behavior quantitatively.

Despite having some inspiring results, we did notice some apparent limitations in this work and would leave them for future work. First, we only performed the experiment with one particular command. Thus, our findings do not necessarily generalize to scenarios where other Echo commands are used. Second, we observed a few cases in all of the experiments where the amount of data transmitted was unexpected. We were unable to analyze and explain what happened as we could not decrypt the data. Finally, there is the inherent weakness of our approach---inferring the Echo's behavior by measuring its traffic. Noise and other disturbances made it harder for us to draw any conclusion statistically.
