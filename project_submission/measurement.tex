\section{Measurements}

% \subsection{Baseline Experiment}

% In the baseline experiment, we kept Alexa in the office overnight without doing anything and caught up all the package that sent out by Alexa.

% In this part, we assume that Alexa will not transfer any voice message to the cloud as there were no voice except some noise generated by nature. Therefore, we could use the package that caught up in this experiment to be the baseline, who were the "necessary" package that Alexa communicate with cloud server. And we assume them to be unsuspicious package, which include some handshake package and broadcast package to let the Alexa confirm which server to communicate with.


\subsection{"Prefix" Experiment}

Amazon specifies in their document~\cite{Alexadocument}, "By default, Alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button)." They claim they will not transmit any data before the wake up word. In order to test out this claim, we gather data as Alexa transmits voice to the server.

Therefore, in this part, we did two different kinds of experiments. First, we played an audio clip containing a prefix phrase as well as a command and another audio clip without a prefix phrase, but just command for Alexa. The prefix phrase is a random phrase that simulates a person talking in his daily life, who then asks Alexa a question. The whole prefix phrase is, "I think I am having some trouble hearing what people trying to say to me. I am not feeling particularly well now. I am also thinking of switching to a new job," and it played for 9~s. The command is: "Alexa, where is New York City?" and it played for 2.5~s. As a result, if Alexa did record some part of the prefix phrase, the total data transmitted for these two audio clips would be significantly different.

Our first experiment varied the length of the prefix phrase from 9~s to 0~s, which was then followed by the 2.5~s command. Our assumption is that, if Alexa truly does the transmission as Amazon states, the size of each transmission package should be the same, as there is only a short command at the end of the phrase. However, if Alexa's recording algorithm misbehaves at all, it might transmit some parts of the prefix phrase to the cloud, in which case the total data sent would vary with the prefix length. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:prefix_many} shows the result of this experiment. It clearly shows that there is no significant difference in the amount of data sent between any of the prefix lengths, as the standard deviation of any one of the points is bigger than the largest gap between any of the points. We were concerned that this experiment simply didn't have enough trials to show any possible correlations, as each command was only played about 15 times, so we ran another experiment, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prefix_two}, that only used two audio clips: one with the full 9~s prefix and one with no prefix. This allowed each command to be run several hundred times. The plot still clearly shows no significant difference between the two commands, so we conclude that the Echo does in fact only send audio captured after the wake-up word.

\end{figure}




\subsection{"Postfix" Experiment}
  
We also want to measure whether Alexa will keep transmitting packages even if Alexa has noticed the whole command and started replying. The assumption here is that, as Alexa has started replying, it means Alexa has fully recognized the whole command and it should not transmit the rest of the sentence onto the server. The experiment fits a real life situation where someone sends a command to Alexa and starts another conversation with others immediately. If Alexa transmits the rest of the conversation, it would definitely raise a privacy concern.

Here, we use "Alexa, where is New York City" as a command sentence and add a 1~s postfix sentence. We gave an approximately 0.5~s gap between the command and postfix sentence to simulate the normal silent gap when people finished a sentence. Then we started playing three different kinds of sentences which are: a) command voice b) command voice with 0.5~s postfix sentence and c) command voice with 1~s postfix sentence.

Fig.~\ref{fig:postfix_gap} shows that again, there is no significant difference between the three trials that we run here. This confirms that the Echo does what we would like it to do, and stops transmitting as soon as it has detected the end of the command.

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{1206/extra_filtered_outgoing_data_size_vs_prefix_time.png}
    \caption{Plot of the total outgoing data size against the length of non-command speech played 0.5~s after a command. The error bars extend to one standard deviation in either direction. Total outgoing data size is calculated as the sum of the TLS packet payload lengths going to the destination IP address with the greatest such sum.}
    \label{fig:postfix_gap}
\end{figure}



We expect, however, that the 0.5~s silence gap between command and postfix sentence is necessary for Alexa to realize the command is over. Here, we played the command with postfix sentence immediately (i.e. delete the silence gap between postfix sentence and command.). We try to find out whether Alexa would automatically cut off the voice once it recognized the following sentence is meaningless. We played command with 0, 1, 2, and 3~s postfix sentences, which contain nonsense speech, to see whether Alexa would cut off the transmission itself.

Fig.~\ref{fig:postfix_nogap} confirms our assumption that Alexa needs some kind of gap to recognize the end of a sentence. Without such a gap, the data clearly shows that the total transmitted data grows directly with the length of the postfix. This indicates that the Echo is recording the entire command with the postfix and transmitting the entire thing to the Amazon server.


\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{1207/extra_filtered_outgoing_data_size_vs_prefix_time.png}
    \caption{Plot of the total outgoing data size against the length of non-command speech played immediately after a command. The error bars extend to one standard deviation in either direction. Total outgoing data size is calculated as the sum of the TLS packet payload lengths going to the destination IP address with the greatest such sum.}
    \label{fig:postfix_nogap}
\end{figure}

The previous two experiments raise the question of how long, exactly, does Alexa need to detect that a command is over and should therefore stop recording. We might want to know this so we know how long we need to pause before we start our conversation to let Alexa aware that the command is over and avoid Alexa transmitting our private conversation onto the Amazon server.

We attempt to determine this by playing the command with different silence gap before playing the whole postfix sentence, to figure out when Alexa would reply a right answer to our command. We tried adding a silence gap between command and postfix sentence that ranged from 0.1 to 0.8~s with a 0.1~s step.

Fig.~\ref{fig:gap} shows the results from this experiment. The blue chunk means Alexa does not respond to the sentence at all. The orange chunk means Alexa responds, but only after the entire postfix plays, and does not know what the command was supposed to be. The green chunk means Alexa noticed the end of the command correctly and immediately replied to that part instead of to the entire sentence. We can see that Alexa does not start correctly detecting the end of the command until at lease a 0.5~s gap occurs, and the gap needs to be at least 0.7~s to ensure that Alexa will correctly detect the end, and not transmit any potentially private conversation.

	\caption{Bar plot showing how often Alexa replied correctly to a command for different gap lengths between the command and non-command speech.}
	\label{fig:gap}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\end{figure}

To confirm our results, we record the total data that the Amazon server sent back to the Echo and we could see a significant difference among "non-response" packages, "error response" packages, and "correct response" packages, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:postfix_variablegap_sizes}. The blue data points indicate the "non-response" experiment trials, the orange data points indicate the "error response" trials, and the the green ones indicate the "correct response" trials. We can clearly see the three levels of data, indicating separate responses to the voice command.

\subsection{"Stop" Experiment}

Following up the above experiment, in this part, we would like to detect how Alexa detects the end of a command. We would like to see whether Alexa stops because of silence or some other detection method.

We tried three experiments here: a) We played background music while playing the command voice and kept playing for a while to see whether Alexa would stop transmitting packages and start replying to the command. This experiment can help us figure out whether Alexa can detect the end of speech even without silence; b) We played the command voice with a background conversation simulating the situation in real life. For example, in a family, if the  father asks something to Alexa while the mother is talking to the child. The father's voice is louder, but the conversation between mother and child will keep going after the father finishes his command. Therefore, we would like to figure out whether Alexa can detect the end of the father's command. c) We start talking immediately after the wake up world and keep talking for a while without stopping to simulate a situation where in a party there is some conversation happening around Alexa, with no natural breaks (due to multiple conversations overlapping). And we want to figure out whether Alexa would stop recording automatically or will keep recording all of the sentences.

In the first experiment, where we played background music while talking to Alexa, we found out that Alexa would stop transmitting packages to Amazon server and start replying, even though the music is still playing. This means Alexa can distinguish light music from human voice.

However, when we played the command voice with some conversation in the background and keep the background conversation going after the command, we found out that Alexa would keep recording if there were no significant silent gap in the whole conversation, even though the conversation and command were generated by different people. As a result, Alexa is not able to detect different peoples' voices and stop automatically. This would indicate that we should be wary of starting a new conversation while someone is using Alexa, as our conversation could be recorded by Alexa well past the end of the command to Alexa. 

Further, to simulating the situation that few conversation happens around Alexa and someone waked up Alexa accidentally, we played a full meaningless sentence with the wake-up word in the beginning and then without any pause in it. When we played a 18s sentence, Alexa stopped at seemingly random points between 6--15~s into the sentence, before it actually ends. This seems to indicate that Alexa tires to protect privacy, once she determines the voice is meaningless.
