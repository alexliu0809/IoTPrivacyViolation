In this work, we answered \todo{X} frequently asked privacy-related questions about Echo. First, does it stream any conversation before it is activated? Second, is any audio being sent after Echo detects the end of a command? We performed measurements that allowed us to quantitatively answer these two questions. We first confirm that usually Echo is not sending any conversation that happens before it is activated. We further verify that in the case of correctly detecting the end of a command, Echo will not stream any conversation that happens after the command. Additionally, We are able to quantify that a 0.7 second gap is needed for Echo to correctly detect the end of a command. While there is a rich literature on analyzing Echo's traffic, ours is the first to quantitatively answer the two questions mentioned above.
%To achieve this, we prerecorded a piece of audio that contained an Echo command ("Alexa, where is New York City?") as well as irrelevant conversations prefixing and suffixing the Echo command. Different segments of this audio were played over and over again in a controlled environment, and all packets transmitted by Echo were recorded. After data cleaning and carefully analyzing the traffic data, we are able to reveal \todo{X} key findings. First, we confirmed that normally Echo would not stream any conversation that happened before the wake word. That said, we did observe that, sporadically, Echo would transmit a non-trivial amount of data during an ongoing conversation that did not contain the wake word. \todo{What else did we find}.
