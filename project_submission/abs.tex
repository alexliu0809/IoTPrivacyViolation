\begin{abstract}
We examine the problem of how much voice data is being streamed to the server by Echo. Echo is Amazon's smart speaker that has an always-on microphone. Conceptually, it should start recording after hearing a certain wake word (Alexa, Echo, etc.) and then send the recorded audio to its server for further processing. Previous work has largely focused on stopping the adversaries from inferring the encrypted user data being transmitted. To our best knowledge, little has been done to verify the fundamental assumption that Echo should only start to record and trasmit data after hearing the wake word. \todo{what else is not done by the others}?

In this work, we performed measurements that shed lights on these mysteries. More specifically, we provided answers to the following questions: 1. Is any conversation before the wake word being streamed to the server? 2. \todo{what else did we measure in this work?}. To achieve this, we prerecorded a piece of audio that contained an Echo command ("Alexa, where is New York City?") as well as irrelevant conversations prefixing and suffixing the Echo command. Different segments of this audio were played over and over again in a controlled environment, and all packets transmitted by Echo were recorded. After data cleaning and carefully analyzing the traffic data, we are able to reveal \todo{X} key findings. First, we confirmed that normally Echo would not stream any conversation that happened before the wake word. That said, we did observe that, sporadically, Echo would transmit a non-trivial amount of data during an ongoing conversation that did not contain the wake word. \todo{What else did we find}.
